# ArcadeFrontend

ArcadeFrontend is an open source [Hyperspin](https://hyperspin-fe.com) alternative using [Godot - Mono](https://godotengine.org) that lets you generate themes on a per game basis.

Themes can be designed in Godot with no need to do any programming, but you can program if you like.

It's very much in alpha and is missing many features. This application is a very specific program and may not fit your needs.

If you want an already established front-end that runs on Linux I'd recommend [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org)

# Making Game Themes

This will most likely change, but using Godot:
- Make a scene in: `res://themes/<your_theme_name>/theme.tscn`
  - `Root Type` should be a  `Control` node and make sure it's *Anchor* spans the `Full Rect`.
  - Do whatever you want in that node.
    - GD Script works, but security implications may not be ideal.
    - Try to do everything via anchors: This __should__ let themes scale to other resolutions. 
  - Currently only tested in 1080p, other resolutions may not scale correctly (for now).
  - Don't need to do anything in GD Script, this [example theme](https://mrsharky.com/ArcadeFrontend/donkey_kong_country.pck) was all animated and done via Godot's editor.

# Setup

- Install and setup the Mono (C#) version of [Godot](https://godotengine.org)
  - Godot Mono will have it's own requirements. 
- Generate a `config.json` - please use [config_example.json](./config_example.json) file as an example
- In Godot, build out the project

# ðŸš§ Roadmap

## Core Functionality
- [x] Wheel menu for selecting games
 - [ ] Make the wheel prettier
 - [ ] Better wheel navigation - Currently only works on single presses
   - [ ] Allow multiple presses
   - [ ] Allow holding
- [x] Launch Applications
- [x] Dynamic theme loading via .pck files (currently only for individual menu items)
  - [ ] Research security implications (probably terrible)
  - [ ] Animated transitions between themes
  - [x] Allow "fall-back" themes (if no individual game theme is available)
    - If you put a theme in the top of the section (before the "items") that will be used as a default 
  - [ ] Setup a website where people can share themes.
- [x] Exit back to menu when game exits
  - Program pauses when focus is lost
- [ ] Controller navigation (haven't tested, it "might" work?)
- [ ] In-app settings menu
- [x] Sub wheel menus
  - [ ] Need sub wheels to remember last location in previous wheel
- [ ] Different resolutions - currently setup for 1080p
- [x] Game Information screen (optional) - Thinking this should be something similar to the PS5 when a game is selected
  - [ ] Started work on a game information screen (see example in `config_example.json`). Still not complete.
  - [ ] Select different game versions in menu
  - [ ] Allow theming
  - [ ] Add more game information to screen
  - [ ] Add screenshot examples
- ...

## Development
- [ ] Setup [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks
  - [ ] Find aa good C# linter
- [ ] Auto-builds via Github Actions
  - [ ] Create an AppImage

## Wishlist
- [ ] No need to setup the `config.json` by hand.
- [ ] Bring up an overlay on top of running games - Something like the Guide button on Xbox (not sure if this is possible)   

# Useful Developer commands:

- If using [nixos](https://nixos.org): `nixos_runner.sh` can be used to test a generated executable.
- Convert mp4 to Godot compatible video:
```shell
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -c:v libtheora -q:v 7 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 4 output.ogv
```
